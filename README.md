This project is a To-Do list application built using React. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Create a New React App**

   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install all the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Modifying the Source Files

You can start editing the source files located in the `src` directory to build your To-Do list application.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- **`npm start`**

  Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- **`npm test`**

  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- **`npm run build`**

  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

  See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
